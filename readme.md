run generate_figures.py using python3.

you will need multiprocessing, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Install these using pip or conda, whichever you use.

If one figure throws an error, uncomment the corresponding method and re-run to generate the remaining figures.

I've only tested this on

Xubuntu 22.04 LTS, python 3.9.12 (with packages installed using conda and pip)
Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS, python 3.8.10 (with packages installed using pip)
